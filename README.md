# Snow Crash

As a developer, you may have to work on softwares that will be used by hundreds of
persons in your career.

If your software shows some weaknesses, these weaknesses will expose the users
through your software.

It is your duty to understand the different techniques used to exploit these weaknesses
in order to spot them and avoid them.

This project is a modest introduction to the wide world of cyber security. A world
where youâ€™ll have no margin for errors.
